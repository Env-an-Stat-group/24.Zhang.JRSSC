Code for "High Resolution Global Precipitation Downscaling with Latent Gaussian Models and Nonstationary SPDE Structure" by Jiachen Zhang, Matthew Bonas, Diogo Bolster, Geir-Arne Fuglstad and Stefano Castruccio.

## Code
 This folder contains code to run simulation study and application for latent Gaussian model. The models included stationary and nonstationary model with and without land/sea effect.
 NS-LS:Nonstationary with land/sea effect. NS:Nonstationary without land/sea effect. S-LS: Stationsry with land/sea effect. S: Stationary without land/sea effect.

## Dataset
This folder include sample dataset that used to run nonstaionary latent Gaussian model with land/sea effect. 
USCRN_Data: USCRN ground observation data of the year 2021. USCRN_Sensor: USCRN ground observation location information.
MERRA2_PRCP: MERRA 2 precipitation of the year 2021. MERRA2_grid: MERRA2 location information.
